# zypper-rs

Playground implementation of zypper in Rust, goal would be to have a zypper compatible 
application but completely rewritten without using any of the C++ zypp codebase. 

This project is mostly meant as a playground to get to know Rust and maybe get some 
inspiration for code refactoring in the original libzypp/zypper codebase.
